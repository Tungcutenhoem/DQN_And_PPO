# DQN & PPO Reinforcement Learning Project
This project implements two popular Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms:
- **DQN (Deep-Q-Network)**
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**

The algorithms tested on environments like "LunarLander-V3" by OpenAI.
## Objectives

- Implement and Compare DQN and PPO in a consistent environment.
- Visualize training performance
- Understand how different between DQN and PPO.

## Result

- With DQN:
    + Max Acuracy: 99.5% for 1000 epochs.
    + Solved most cases in environment.
    + Save fuel with small finish time.

- With PPO:
    + Max Acuracy: 85% for 1000 epochs.
    + Fuel used is lower than DQN.
    + Finish time is shorter than DQN
